Parkinsonâ€™s Disease diagnosis classification using gait cycle similarities

The objectif is to do Feature Extraction from the orginal dataset. then use the new generated dataset with the new features with different classification machine learning algorithms to predict parkinson's disease. I used Similarity measures like 'Euclidean Distance' ,'Time-Wraped Edit Distance', 'Dynamic Time Wrapping', 'Edit Distance on Real sequence': to measure similarity between Timeseries Data. the timeseries data represent the Force VGRF(Vertical Ground Reaction Force) of people while walking.


*Feature extraction with Similarity Measurement (on Timeseries data)

*Dealing with unbalanced data

*Using Unsupervised and supervised Learning 

*evaluate models
